I'm writing you after hearing about you from my father, whom you spoke to on your recent flight to Boston.
I'd like to introduce myself to you and give you an idea of what I can do.

I am experienced with both hardware and software.
I've designed and written a number of software projects that are open source.
Along with being able to take a software project from start to finish; I have experience writing technical documentation for them, writing tests to show that the software performs to the specifications and documentation. On the hardware side I have rack mounted existing servers to create a more organized workspace.  Installed security cameras and set up a dedicated monitoring system to record any movement.

I can be contacted by email at \href{mailto:ryan@voots.org}{ryan@voots.org}, or by phone at 678-551-2387.
Thank you for taking the time to look at my resume to see if you know anyone who could use my help.
