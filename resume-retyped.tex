\subsection{Work History}

\affiliation[DevOps Contractor]{ThinkIQ}{March 2020-June 2020}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Main Project - Rearchitecting deployment stack
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Original architecture had lots of overhead, deploying about a dozen pieces in containers in kubernetes.  Including production databases.  This lead to performance and capacity issues on customer systems
  \item I redesigned the system to be deployable as a single VM image, reducing overhead and making hosted database solutions such as Amazon RDS and Azure Database easier to use.
  \item Helped consolidate the design of internal scripting systems using python to have a single managed environment on the new VM images.  Previously there were multiple copies of python depending on which part of the system an action was started from, each with their own copies of installed modules and vendor libraries that were frequently different versions.
  \end{compactitem}
\item Developer Support
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Provided experienced code reviews for vendor python libraries and code.
  \item Assisted in securing the design of the authentication system combing GraphQL and the existing CMS (Joomla) so that future API clients can be authenticated securely among services using JWT tokens.

\item Customer Production Systems
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Setup additional monitoring for production systems (Healthchecks.io + PagerDuty)

\affiliation[Creator, Lead Designer, and Lead Developer]{App::EvalserverAdvanced}{2006? - Present}
\begin{compactitem}
\item App::EvalserverAdvanced is an application sandbox and ephemeral container system that allows secure and safe execution of arbitrary programs and source code.  It's currently powering teaching and learning tools for the Perl community on IRC and \url{https://perl.bot/}. 
\item The sandbox and container are completely configurable to allow for multiple security contexts and environments for different applications and requirements.
\item The server has a formally defined protocol allowing for asynchronous job creation and reporting.  This allows both parallel running of applications and in theory priority based queuing of jobs based on desired priority and session history.
